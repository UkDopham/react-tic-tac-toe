# Tic Tac Toe React Project

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. I created this project to train and improve my skills in React development.

## Project Purpose

The main goals of this project were to:
- Gain hands-on experience with React fundamentals
- Practice implementing game logic in a React application
- Improve my understanding of state management in React
- Enhance my skills in creating interactive user interfaces

## Features

- Interactive Tic Tac Toe game board
- Alternating turns between X and O players
- Game status display (next player, winner, or draw)
- History of moves with the ability to jump to previous game states

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 12.0 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-react.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe-react
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to develop my React skills, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Adding a AI opponent option
- Implementing a scoreboard for multiple games
- Improving the UI/UX design
